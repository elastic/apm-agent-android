=== Networking frameworks

Distributed tracing will only work if you are using one of the supported networking frameworks.

For the supported HTTP libraries, the agent automatically creates spans for outgoing HTTP requests and propagates tracing headers.
The spans are named after the schema `<method> <host>`, for example `GET elastic.co`.
