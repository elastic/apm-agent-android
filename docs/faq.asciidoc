[[faq-bytecode-instrumentation]]
=== Is the agent doing bytecode instrumentation?

No, although if you'd like to get automatic instrumentations, you can add https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-android/tree/main/auto-instrumentation[extensions] that make use of bytecode instrumentation.

[[faq-metrics-aggregation]]
=== Metrics aggregation strategy

The metrics aggregation strategy used by the agent is https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/blob/976edfde504193f84d19936b97e2eb8d8cf060e2/sdk/metrics/src/main/java/io/opentelemetry/sdk/metrics/data/AggregationTemporality.java#L15[DELTA].

[[faq-unsupported-technologies]]
=== What if the agent doesn't support the technologies I'm using?

The agent is built on top of https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/java/getting-started/[OpenTelemetry]. You can use its public API to create custom spans and transactions.
You should also take a look at the https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-android/tree/main/auto-instrumentation[automatic instrumentation extensions] currently available where the tool you need to instrument might be supported already.
