# Component nomenclature

The agent consists of multiple components designed for flexibility and adaptability to a variety of use cases, most of them are _core components_ while a few others are _extended components_.

Core components refers to components and configurations that Elastic has explicitly tested, validated, and committed to maintaining under our [Support Policies](https://www.elastic.co/support). This includes regular updates, issue triaging, and guidance from Elastic’s support and engineering teams. Components outside of this supported set may still work, but Elastic does not provide guaranteed support or troubleshooting assistance for them.

## Categorization

### Core

Core components are essential for common use cases. They are fully supported under your Service Level Agreement (SLA).

### Extended

Extended components are a curated set of optional components that enhance functionality and are technically compatible. These are not part of Elastic’s core product journeys and are not covered by SLAs. You’re free to use them, but Elastic provides limited support.
