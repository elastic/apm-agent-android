If you need to create your own, custom spans, metrics and logs, you can do so by accessing the https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/java/manual/[OpenTelemetry Java SDK APIs] that this agent is built on top.

=== OpenTelemetry Entrypoint

After completing the <<setup,setup>> process, the Agent will have configured the OpenTelemetry entrypoint for you and made it globally accessible.
In order to access to the configured OpenTelemetry instance you need to use the `GlobalOpenTelemetry` class as shown below.

[source,java]
----
class MyClass {

    // Example of how to obtain an OpenTelemetry tracer to create custom Spans.
    public void myMethod() {
        Tracer tracer = GlobalOpenTelemetry.getTracer("my-tracer-scope-name");
        // You can use your tracer instance as explained in OpenTelemetry's span creation guide: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/java/manual/#create-spans
    }
}
----

In a similar way you can create other types of https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/[signals] by accessing their entrypoints through the GlobalOpenTelemetry class, for example for custom metrics, you can use: `GlobalOpenTelemetry.getMeter("my-metric-scope-name")` and follow https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/java/manual/#metrics[OpenTelemetry's guide] on creating manual metrics.
